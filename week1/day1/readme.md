#  Day 1: Introduction to Verilog RTL Design & Synthesis

Welcome to **Day 1** of the RTL Workshop!  
Today, you'll embark on your journey into digital design by learning Verilog, open-source simulation with **Icarus Verilog (iverilog)**, and the basics of logic synthesis using **Yosys**. This guide will walk you through practical labs, essential concepts, and insightful explanations to help you build a strong foundation in RTL design.

## 1. What is a Simulator, Design, and Testbench?

###  Simulator

A **simulator** is a software tool that checks your digital circuitâ€™s functionality by applying test inputs and viewing outputs. This helps you verify your design before hardware implementation.

###  Design

The **design** is your Verilog code describing the intended logic functionality.

###  Testbench

A **testbench** is a simulation environment that applies various inputs to your design and checks if the outputs are correct.
